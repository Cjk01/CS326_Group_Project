        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <h3>Cachely is a web application which aims to make learning and memorization a streamlined and enjoyable experience for all. We promote efficient learning by drawing upon the decades of research by psychologists in determining how humans learn best. In particular, the usage of spaced repetition and active recall which are techniques proven to be highly effective in regard to long term retention and retrieval of information. 

          We do this by allowing users to create, share, and study “Decks” which are essentially collections of flashcards. 
          
          <br><br>What differentiates these from normal flashcards is that Cachely automatically produces a study schedule for the user which is dynamically updated based on the success or failure of specific test items. This study schedule is based on the aforementioned research of spaced repetition, producing a schedule which minimizes time spent studying, and maximizes information retention. Not only can these flashcards be used for the memorization of basic facts, but also for sets of problems of different types (ex. a set of cards which require the calculation of derivatives for a calculus class). 
          
          Although there are existing tools (Anki, Quizlet) which attempt to solve this problem, none of them have all three of the following qualities which we think are important in the education space. 
          <ol>
          <li>Completely Free</li>
          <li>Full set of features available from the browser</li>
          <li>Easy sharing and creation of decks for a variety of card types (fact, problem, etc.)</li>
          </ol>
             We aim to satisfy all three of these criteria to produce a learning tool that empowers everyone to learn more efficiently, as a community.</h3>

      <section id="application-parts">
        <h2>Important Parts of the Application</h2>
        <h3>There are four main parts of Cachely. The first part, which we think is the most important, is where the user will spend the majority of their time within the application, the “Study” page. On this page, the user will be prompted with their study schedule for the day (a set of flashcards to solve). One by one, the user will solve each card, with the results of this session determining their study schedule for the next day. Our goal is to make this page simple and intuitive, so as to not overwhelm or distract the user while they are studying. Once the study session is completed, we provide the user with their overall statistics and progress over time, with the goal to encourage daily usage. 

          The second part is the “Community” page, which is the first page you see when entering the web application. This section shows popular and new decks which users have created, as well as a prompt to log in or sign up if they are not signed in. If the user is signed in, then there will be a prompt to start studying if they have any cards left to complete for the day. 
          
          The third part is the “Deck” page, which is where users can create decks, search for decks, and add decks to their study schedule. The contents of decks, as well as user ratings / comments about particular decks can also be seen. The deck creator will allow for multiple types of cards to be created, with text and image inputs as an option. Once a deck is created, it can be set to public or private to the user. 
          
          Lastly, we have the “User” page. This is where the user can see their account details, as well as their user statistics in a clear and readable format. We plan to have plots to represent things like cards studied, as well as consecutive days studied, in order to encourage users to log in daily. The user can opt to make their profile public or private as well. 
          
          All of these parts combine to make Cachely a social learning platform which encourages daily use, to most effectively take advantage of spaced repetition and active recall, promoting efficient learning for our users. 
          </h3>

      <section id="data-requirements">
        <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
        <h3>Cachely's core value proposition lies within its intuitive and easy-to-use learning system, which uses spaced repetition and active recall to help people remember and retrieve information more effectively. As such, a scalable and efficient NoSQL database meets the demand for this challenge. The notecards in this database will be stored using JSON along with any relevant metadata-- features such as card accuracy, next encounter window, etc. Access to this valuable metadata will allow Cachely to automatically apply spaced repetition and active recall principles to maximize your learning gains.

          Secondly, we will store user data of various types, from username, password, and subject interests to advanced usage features like progress through certain decks of cards, cards with which the user most struggles, a streak to incentivize consistency, and more. These features will help motivate users to consistently learn, identify their weak spots, track accuracy on their different decks, and share and celebrate their progress and growth throughout their learning endeavors.
          
          Thirdly, user data and preferences will be at the heart of Cachely's community-driven side. From streaks to compete with friends to finding decks of cards based on subjects of interest, community data will inspire people to learn in a collaborative and social setting that will elevate the learning experience for everybody. Additionally, we'll track a set of followed profiles and followers for each user, which will help users study and be incentivized to reach out to other people and share their knowledge and expertise via the decks they create. 
            
          Overall, the rich, personalized study data from user-created decks and usage data will serve as the heart of Cachely's learning model. Additionally, community-driven data will serve as the soul of Cachely's social model. These two integrated data systems will provide a socially driven, intellectually compelling, free, and accessible solution for future generations of learners.

          Cachely’s interface is intended to be easily understood without the need for extensive tutorials. The home screen displays a simple navigation bar with options leading to the User Profile, Decks, Study, and Community screens, with the most “urgent” decks the user needs to study below. The idea of spatial repetition requires users to consistently return to sets, so we believed it important to include the decks a user needs to study based on our model right there when they sign in.

            The Decks screen displays a list of the decks you’ve been studying in the order of urgency, with screens to separate the decks you’ve made, the decks you’ve saved from others, and decks made by users you follow. At the bottom of the side bar, you can choose to create a new deck.

            The study screen is a simple view of a term that when clicked will reveal the definition, allowing users to study at their own pace and decide for themselves if they’ve remembered the term well enough. They can select correct or incorrect based on their own judgment, and they can find information about their performance and the deck itself in the borders.

              The profile screen for a user includes some basic information about them that they can opt to provide along with their most saved decks by others. A User’s personal profile will have options to edit their information, but this is the view that most profiles will generally take. As with other aspects of the wireframes, we intend to adjust the view of this screen as we find it necessary during the actual implementation.

                From the User’s Profile page, a user can also find the profiles of the users they’ve chosen to follow, as is indicated by the star icon that can be easily toggled, along with the list of users following them.

                  The Community page allows users to find and search for different decks and users, easily adding decks to their own collection and following users they find have overlapping areas of study.

        <h2>Connection to the real world</h2>
        <h3>Knowledge is a basic human right and the most important and powerful tool a person can have. Whether they are a student studying for a class or an adult trying to study up for an important exam. This means that it is of utmost importance that education is accessible to anyone who needs it and that it is available to everyone equally. There are, of course, web applications for studying and expert answers like Quizlet and Chegg; however, they seek to monetize this knowledge, infringing on this right. Cachely seeks to be a completely free app which is meant to promote equal access to education and knowledge to not only people who can afford it, but to everyone. With this app, people will be able to come up with their own decks that will be available to all through the “Community” page of the application. As more users participate in creating decks, more and more knowledge will become available to people who need it on demand. There will be no paywalls and no premium mode that locks people out of their preferred way of studying what they need to.

      <section id="integrative-experience">
        <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
        <h3>No matter what discipline a student pursues, and no matter the school they attend, the simple and most obvious constant in academics is the need to study. While there are many different ways to settle information into one’s brain, repetition is one that can be relied on in any situation to achieve a reasonable grade, but that will only get you so far. It’s common to feel like you simply forget everything you crammed in before a test, especially in college when you’re expected to push yourself forward more with less time than in secondary education. Cachely is intended to help solve that problem in a way that helps individuals and education communities together at the same time. While you could just sit in your dorm the night before a test studying all night alone, we believe that it would benefit just about any community to have a simple free application in which they could create their own study tools and share them with their peers while benefiting from others doing the same as well as those who have taken a class and moved on. Our use of spatial repetition creates a schedule for you along with a very simple studying method, taking the need for cramming or complicated methods away, and our community features provide a timeless archive of tools at the university’s disposal to ensure nobody struggles to find the information they need. No matter what class we’ve taken, there’s always a need to study, and there are always others with the exact same need as you. Cachely has the potential to cultivate a deeper sense of academic community within the university as a whole, beyond any department or college, with a level of simplicity and low commitment that would encourage anybody to join in on the collective study center.
