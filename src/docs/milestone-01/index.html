        <h3>Role: Back-End</h3>
        <p>experience with full-stack web development, and that is also what I am interested in. Have experience with git, github, js, html/css, databases (mongo/mysql). I would be interested in focusing on the back-end of the web application for whichever project idea we decide to pursue.

        <h3>Aryan Sajith</h3>
        <h3>Role: Data</h3>
        <p>Solid backend experience, limited front end experience. Technologies I’ve worked with include git, github, js, html/css, databases(mongo), and other commonly used languages(C/C++, Java, Python, etc.). I would prefer to work on the back end but would love to gain additional frontend experience. Overall, I’m excited to contribute whatever is necessary for the team to thrive.</p>

        <h3>Jonah Osborne</h3>
        <h3>Role: Front-End</h3>
        <p>I have very limited experience with web development overall, but I have a strong interest in writing code and seeing the results of it manifested in interactive ways. I have prior experience working in JavaScript as well as other languages such as C, Java, and Python, and am confident in my ability to learn new skills in a timely fashion and get work done as is needed. Whatever I need to do, I intend to find a way to do it.</p>

        <h3>Daniil Koval</h3>
        <h3>Role: Documentation</h3>
        <p>I do not have much experience with html/css, but I am very excited to experiment more and work on learning them. They seem relatively user-friendly, so I am confident that I will be able to effectively use them. I have a little more experience with Javascript, and look forward to helping out the team. Technologies I’ve used are js, html/css, and I’ve used some python for data analysis (though I don’t really think this is too relevant).</p>
